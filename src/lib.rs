//! An owned, fixed length buffer of bytes (`u8`s) and helper types.
//!
//! The primary type is [`OwnedBuf`] which is a sort-of abstract wrapper type for an owned
//! sequence of bytes. [`OwnedSlice`] and [`OwnedCursor`] give read access to the filled
//! part of an `OwnedBuf` and write access to the unfilled part of an `OwnedBuf`, respectively.
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf` is primarily useful where an IO operation takes ownership of supplied buffers, for
//! example [`async OwnedRead`](TODO).
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf`'s data can be in either filled (i.e., data has been written to a byte) or unfilled.
//! Unfilled data may be with initialized or uninitialized. An `OwnedBuf` may contain all three
//! kinds of data at the same time and tracks the state of bytes.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf` is never directly created. Instead, an existing sequence of bytes (e.g., a
//! `Vec<u8>`) is transformed into an `OwnedBuf`. Unlike when taking a slice, the previous sequence
//! type is consumed and ownership of its memory is transferred to the `OwnedBuf` (the memory itself
//! does not move).
//!
//! The `OwnedBuf` is then used. It is transformed into an `OwnedCursor` to write to it and into an
//! `OwnedSlice` to read from it. These types can be transformed back into an `OwnedBuf` as needed.
//! With each transformation, ownership is passed to the new type. If needed the `OwnedBuf` can be
//! reset.
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf` can be transformed back into the original sequence type. Any data written to the
//! `OwnedBuf` can be read. The sequence type can be used in the usual way, including its
//! destruction. If an `OwnedBuf` is not transformed back into the previous type, then its destructor
//! calls a function supplied when the buffer is created. Typically, that converts the buffer into
//! the original sequence type and calls it destructor.
//!
//! ### Destructor safety
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf` takes a destructor as a function pointer and calls it from the `OwnedBuf`'s
//! destructor. The function pointer is marked as `unsafe` and the safety invariant is that the
//! `OwnedBuf` was created from the collection type expected by the destructor function. This
//! invariant must be ensured when the `OwnedBuf` is created, thus `OwnedBuf::new` is `unsafe`.
//!
//! ## Conversion from user types
//!
//! This module includes functionality to transform an `OwnedBuf` from and to a `Vec<u8>` or
//! `Vec<MaybeUninit<u8>>`. `OwnedBuf` is designed to be usable with any owned sequence of bytes. To
//! create an `OwnedBuf` use [`OwnedBuf::new`], you'll supply a data pointer, some metadata, and a
//! destructor function (see below). To transform from an `OwnedBuf`, you use `into_raw_parts` to
//! get the internal state of the `OwnedBuf` and then create the sequence type in the usual way.
//!
//! An `OwnedBuf`'s destructor function has type `&'static dyn Fn(&mut OwnedBuf<A>)`, it passes a
//! mutable reference to the destructor, however, it is guaranteed that the `OwnedBuf` will not be
//! accessed after calling the destructor function. Typically, the destructor function will use
//! [`std::ptr::read`] to get the `OwnedBuf` by value, transform it into the original sequence type,
//! and (implicitly) call its destructor.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Creating an `OwnedBuf` from a `Vec`.
//!
//! ```
//! # use owned_buf::OwnedBuf;
//! let vec = vec![1u8, 2, 3];
//! let buf: OwnedBuf = vec.into();
//!
//! // Use `filled` to view `buf` as an `OwnedSlice` to read from it.
//! assert_eq!(1, buf.filled()[0]);
//!
//! // `Vec`'s destructor will be called via `OwnedBuf`'s.
//! ```
//!
//! Writing into an `OwnedBuf` and converting it back into a `Vec`.
//!
//! ```
//! # use owned_buf::OwnedBuf;
//! let vec: Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(8);
//! let buf: OwnedBuf = vec.into();
//! assert_eq!(0, buf.filled_len());
//! assert_eq!(8, buf.capacity());
//!
//! // Get a cursor to write into the `OwnedBuf`.
//! let mut cursor = buf.unfilled();
//! cursor.write_slice(&[0, 1, 2, 3]);
//!
//! // Convert the cursor back into an `OwnedBuf`.
//! let buf = cursor.into_buf();
//! assert_eq!(4, buf.filled_len());
//!
//! let vec = unsafe { buf.into_vec() };
//! assert_eq!(4, vec.len());
//! assert_eq!(8, vec.capacity());
//! assert_eq!(3, vec[3]);
//! ```

/// An owned, fixed length buffer of bytes.
///
/// An `OwnedBuf` is created from an existing collection type, it is an abstract
/// wrapper of sorts. See the [module docs](self) for details and examples.
///
/// This type is a sort of "double cursor". It tracks three regions in the buffer: a region at the beginning of the
/// buffer that has been logically filled with data, a region that has been initialized at some point but not yet
/// logically filled, and a region at the end that is fully uninitialized. The filled region is guaranteed to be a
/// subset of the initialized region. The filled part can grow or shrink, the initialized part can
/// only grow, and capacity of the buffer (i.e., its total length) is fixed.
///
/// In summary, the contents of the buffer can be visualized as:
/// ```not_rust
/// [             capacity              ]
/// [ filled |         unfilled         ]
/// [    initialized    | uninitialized ]
/// ```
///
/// The API of `OwnedBuf` is focussed on creation and destruction. To read from the filled part,
/// get a view of the buffer using an `OwnedSlice`. To write into the unfilled part, get a view of
/// the buffer using and `OwnedCursor`. Both of these types can be converted back into an `OwnedBuf`.
